# iot-smart-sensory-weighing
Iot smart weighting concept code - Coded in C language [ Hardware assembly code ] - Module for Arduino 
In this project we have used few libraries. For interfacing I2C 16X2 LCD display with NodeMCU, a library called LiquidCrystal.h is used along with Wire.h library to use I2C bus. 
Make sure you download and add this I2C LCD Display library to your Arduino IDE. 

For measuring weight from the HX711 we have used a library called HX711 library, download and add this to your IDE. 
With the help of this library, by using just one line we can determine the weight and also, we can calibrate our IoT load cell for accurate results.
Do remember HX711 calibration plays a vital role in determining the accuracy of your results.

*ESP8266 is a Wi-Fi module with in-built microcontroller mainly used for making IoT applications due to its low cost and its compatibility with other microcontrollers. Below are some tutorials and projects to start with ESP8266 based IoT projects.
